Authors are invited to submit abstracts (up to 4 pages, in any reasonable 1- or
2-column format) for contributed talks to be given at the workshop. Submission
is via easychair (**Link TBA**).

We encourage submissions of full paper drafts (if available) along with the
abstract. Because there are no formal proceedings for the workshop, submission
of material that is to be submitted to (or to appear in) a refereed conference
(e.g., SODA '21, SoCG '21) is allowed and encouraged; please indicate clearly
with the submission if the work has already been presented/accepted elsewhere.
