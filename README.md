# FWCG 21

The FWCG 21 site is created using github pages, jekyll, and the slate theme.

The site is deployed from the `gh-pages` branch.

You can find information on how to [configure the slate
theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate).

You can develop by editing markdown file directly in github or
[locally](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
